# Gourdstitch

A Google App Engine website built with python and a work in progress.

Eventually I'd like the website to host a free eBook on the gourdstitch  
beadwork technique and tutorials, image galleries, and a link to a shop.

You can find the project [here](http://gourdstitch.appspot.com/).
