	        <h2>Fascinated by gourd stitch beadwork?</h2>
	    </header>
	    <p>People refer to this amazing style of beadwork by many names. It is often called "Peyote Stitch" since it is used to decorate Native American Church ceremonial items. Out of respect for Native beadworkers and Church members, I'll refer to the beadwork covered in this website as "Gourd Stitch." Some of the most accomplished Native beadworkers use variations of the two-drop method, but the tools and instruction found on this website will focus on the three-drop technique.</p>

					    <h3><a href="http://bead-calculator.appspot.com/">The Bead Calculator: A tool for three drop gourd stitchers.</a></li></h3>
					    <p><b>To use:</b> first, figure out how many beads it will take to go around the object you plan to bead. This is done by wrapping your initial thread (no need to run the thread through your objects leatherwork) around the object enough times for it to stick, stringing enough beads on the thread to make it around the object, and then wrapping the beaded thread around the object to check. Ideally, your total number will be divisible by six. If it is, then you’re set to go. Any initial bead count divisible by six will allow you to use design elements that that create a zig-zag with five beads on the long side, and three on the short side. This is the most common design element used in gourd stitch. Other combinations are possible, but may force you to use less desirable design element counts like seven and four, or nine and five, or to add or remove bead to reach a more desirable number. The bead calculator will also give you alternative options if your original number doesn't work.</p

					<h3>About</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I’ve been beading for over fifteen years. Even though my first beadwork project used some unidentifiable “peyote-stitch-like”  technique, and despite the fact that I’ve flirted with other techniques like “lazy-stitch” and loom work (“Ack”— never did get the hang of loom work…), the majority of my projects incorporate the three drop gourd stitch. The patterns that develop with gourd stitch are fantastic, colors blend in a beautiful way, and designs using three drop gourd stitch just seem more “organic.” I also enjoy building websites (such as this one) and I'm learning to code using Python (that's how I built the <a href="http://bead-calculator.appspot.com">Bead Calculator</a>).

					<p>A very interesting read. <q>For many beadworkers, creating designs taps deeply embedded beliefs so that beaded objects reflect their thoughts and prayers, their aesthetic sensibilities, and their sense of being Navajo—but above all, their attention to light and its properties.</q></p>
					<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Native-American-Beadwork-Traditional-Techniques/dp/0936984120">Native American Beadwork: Traditional Beading Techniques for the Modern-Day Beadworker by Georg J. Barth</a></li>
					<p>One of the first beadwork books I ever read. I believe that the gourd stitch design elements chart that I used to use (before I created the much more sophisticated Bead Calculator!) comes from this book. </p>
